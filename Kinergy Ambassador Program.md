The Kinera Ambassador Programme is an initiative ran to support potential
contributors to the Kinera community and ecosystem.

## How it works

If you are enthusiastic about Kinera (Cinema, Videos Content, Movies Festivals, Ranks, Motion picture in general) and Web3 and are willing to help the community grow, you can
join the program and receive funding for hosting events, gain access to communication channels of
core team members, and gain access to our events.

There are many ways you can get involved in expanding Kineâ€™s ecosystem, such as:

- Contributing code and documentation related to the ecosystem
- Speaking about Kinera at events, workshops, and meetups
- Writing blog posts
- Representing Kinera in your region
- Mentoring and onboarding newcomers
- Identifying partnerships and opportunities for the Kinera ecosystem
- Participating in calls and tasks that help drive the ecosystem forward
