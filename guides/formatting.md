# WHAT IS KINERA?

Kinera is a media platform that rewards users for ranking and classifying content using tokenised voting and allocation mechanisms.

### In this Alfa 1.0 release, you can:

1. <strong>Rank and propose films and videos in Rankings by voting with tokens.</strong> 
This will give you an extra 18% annual reward if you leave your tokens on the lists during that time. 

2. <strong> Constellations: </strong> You can create video or film competitions. You will receive 2% of the tokens used in the competition. The users who vote for the winner receive the tokens from the users who vote in the less voted. 

3. <strong>See the best videos from the competitions on random channels.</strong> The creation of Streaming Video Channels will come later. 

4. <strong>On the Social Page, you will find your public profile,</strong> where you can comment on other users' posts and preferences. Show your competition or give opinions about the films and videos listed in the rankings. Follow your favourite curators. 

##### Browse the Help menu to know the exact rules for these features.

##### An incentivised test net is on the way.
