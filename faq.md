# Frequently Asked Questions

## What is Kinera?

Kinera is a decentralised media platform that rewards users for ranking and classifying content using tokenised voting and allocation mechanisms.

## Why should I join Kinera?

On Kinera, you join other participants to help each other navigate the overwhelming quantity of information on the internet. Here, participants help each other find films, videos and other content that aligns with their interests and has been “vetted” by other participants.

## What does it mean to be an active participant in Kinera?

As an active member of the Kinera community, you can publish your own original material or post material from other platforms, interact with other participants and their content, write reviews, and propose constellations and rankings. 


In the future Kinera will propose a feature for crowdsourcing of new projects.


## How many tokens do I need to be able to navigate the testnet?

When you create a social profile, you get 1000 play tokens. Every week you can follow the instructions and ask for 1000 more. 

## How do I create a social profile?

Follow the instructions on the dApp page. 

## Can I create a profile on the platform without revealing my identity?

In Kinera, we will offer various methods for managing privacy and identity, though the specific techniques are yet to be determined, where users can remain anonymous on the platform and choose how much of their identity is public. 
At this stage, we present four distinct levels of information access that may be necessary:

1. [`Identity level 0:`](/configuration/project.md#poweredbyretype) Prove that you are a unique human and that only one wallet in the network is assigned to you. 
2. [`Identity level 1:`](/configuration/project.md#poweredbyretype) The user has to provide proof of this phone number, email, home address, and a copy of a national identification card or passport. 
3. [`Identity level 2:`](/configuration/project.md#poweredbyretype) The user must prove he is a Film Producer or Content Producer. This will be used to facilitate film and video upload.
4. [`Identity level 3:`](/configuration/project.md#poweredbyretype) The user links his email with one Kinera account or with a Web 2.0 social network.

## What is a REP token?

Reputation tokens (REP) are a tool to acknowledge and reward the positive contributions made by community members to enhance the value of the information available on the platform.
Users have two types of reputation tokens: lifelong reputation tokens and 200Rep. 
200Rep is a ranking system that reflects the reputation earned by members over the previous 200 days. For the sake of simplicity, this 200Rep is the reputation metric used for decision-making across various aspects of the platform.
Reputation is crucial for social tools to establish connections with other users and achieve Senior Member status that grants access to all platform features. These tokens serve as a measure of the trust that the community places in each user, representing their influence within the community.

## How do I become a Curator?

All participants can take on the role of curator, starting as Junior Curators, with limited access to the functions of the platform and must earn a reputation to rise to the Senior level. 

For Juniors, there is a fast track to gaining Senior status: 

    1. A moderator can safelist a Junior member to Senior status by allocating Kinex tokens to his actions on the platform.
    
    2. Users can gain Senior status by allocating a yet-to-be-defined number of Kinex tokens. 
    
In both cases, the Kinex tokens are returned five days after the user earned the REP tokens, allowing other members to become seniors. Moderators still monitor these users and have their publications highlighted to be more visible. 

With a yet-to-be-defined number of REP tokens earned and kept in the previous  24 hours, a Junior member is moved to the Senior level.

Junior members with negative REP must allocate Kinex tokens to publish on a timeline.

## What does a curator do, and how can I become one?

On Kinera, all members can be curators, engaging at a level in accordance with their experience and interests. As a curator you can submit content for the platform, propose constellations and festivals, share with the community your knowledge and views, write reviews and participate in voting. 

## What is the role of a Moderator on Kinera? 

Moderators are community members upholding civility on the Kinera platform. They handle content disputes, address infractions to community rules, and contribute to maintaining an environment free of toxicity, hate, and disinformation

Moderators are volunteers who call and resolve violations of the community rules in moderation events. Only senior members above the Top 15% of Reputation can become guardians. They do this by changing their status in the settings menu.

The moderation scope: users' posts, comments, constellations, treasury proposals and subscription channels, the names proposed to be used in rankings or videos or films proposed to be in the list.


## What is the role of an Ambassador for Kinera? 

Ambassadors are experienced community members who actively contribute to Kinera. They serve as intermediaries, supporting connections between producers, creators, and the broader community, organising meetups or other community events. For some of these activities, they can propose treasury spending. All ambassadors are volunteer participants.

## What is a ranking?

Rankings are spaces where users propose or vote by allocating tokens to their favourite videos and films. This token allocation offers token rewards in a process similar to the nomination of validators in a proof-of-stake network like Kusama. 

https://guide.kusama.network/docs/learn-consensus/#nominated-proof-of-stake

The term staking refers to the tokens won by the members that allocated Kinex to information classification processes in the rankings.

In the medium term, we aim to open ranking creation to the community and encourage discussions and debates about the best videos and films; this can happen by collaborating with other existing platforms.

At the platform's launch, the Kine Foundation will propose a set of rankings, from the origins of cinema and productions from small countries to rankings that support the themes launched for new streaming channels. The first themes to launch will be Crypto Channels and Best of Tok Tok. After an evaluation period, rank creation will be open to community members.

## What is a ranking?

Constellations, festivals, and competitions are different names for the same feature within Kinera. Constellations function as a second layer of curation, where users can propose and vote on their personal choices in competition with other members. 

Constellations cover various categories: Cinema, Stars,  Just Fun, We Festivals, Artificial Intelligence and Gaming. Each category has specific objectives that cater to different target audiences and fulfil diverse needs within the ecosystem. Each constellation opens a fixed set of tags that guide the user during the classification process.

## How do you Stake tokens in Kinera?

Staking is a term used to describe the ranking of  information, weaponizing the wisdom of the crowd.  Staking is a voting mechanism where the community gets rewards when it allocates tokens to films or videos in a ranking list. Those who vote for the proposal with the majority get, as a reward, the tokens of those who voted with the minority, thus gaining some economic benefit.

## How do I get tokens?

Kinera MVP uses faucet tokens. You get 1000 when creating an account and every 7 days, you can use our faucet to ask for more.

## If I want to sell my tokens, where can I go?

We use play tokens until the mainnet release. After the official launch of the platform, the Kinex token will trade on Kraken and other trading platforms. 

## Where can I find a list of resources on Kinera?

## At what stage is the platform being developed now?

## How do I get testnet Kinex?

When you open the dApp you will be guided through the process of setting up a personal profile and wallet. With a wallet you can download play tokens to participate in the testnet.

## When did Kinera launch?
